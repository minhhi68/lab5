      Though I have always been optimistic and hopeful for whatever I have done so far.
      I still consider myself as a fresher/beginner. There are many things that I 
      have to improve to be a better version of me. One of the reasons why I am
      taking it seriously because I know as the society and markets change rapidly,
      I have to be good enough to prove myself as whom the recruiters needed. The job we will spend on the rest of our life
      matters. When you love what you work, the work will also love you either.
